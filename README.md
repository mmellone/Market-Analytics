# Market-Analytics
###Original Authors: Mitchell Mellone

This project consists of algorithms and databases designed to collect data on the current state of financial markets and make predictions regarding future financial asset performance.

For the initial development phase of the project we want to focus on 4 different areas: **data collection**, **identifying buy/sell signals**, **machine learning**, and **data visualization and user interface**. Features added to the code should be added to this readme under each appropriate section.

##Data Collection
#####Create and maintain a database of financial data from stocks and other securities. Seek to describe the current and previous states of the market in a way that best facilitates the prediction of future trends and price movements.
- Get current list of traded stocks
- Get basic data from common stocks
- Place that basic data into an AWS MySQL database

##Signal Identification and Alerts
#####Identify the potential movements of securities and attempt to create basic investment strategies and aid in decision making.
