# Market-Analytics
###Original Authors: David Chen, Lucien Christie-Dervaux, Mitchell Mellone

This project consists of algorithms and databases designed to collect data on the current state of financial markets and make predictions regarding future financial asset performance.

For the initial development phase of the project we want to focus on 4 different areas: **data collection**, **identifying buy/sell signals**, **machine learning**, and **data visualization and user interface**. Features added to the code should be added to this readme under each appropriate section.

###Data Collection
#####Analyze historical trends to learn patterns that can be extrapolated to predict future movements.
- nothing yet

##Signal Identification and Alerts
#####Identify the potential movements of securities and attempt to create basic investment strategies and aid in decision making.
- nothing yet

##Machine Learning
#####Analyze historical trends to learn patterns that can be extrapolated to predict future movements.
